# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge 

## Overview

This project analyzes home sales data using **PySpark SQL** to extract key insights about housing prices based on various attributes. The goal is to demonstrate data processing with Spark by creating temporary views, running SQL queries, caching tables, and working with partitioned parquet files.

## Dataset

- **File:** `home_sales_revised.csv`
- **Source:** Provided AWS S3 bucket URL:  
  `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv`
- The dataset includes details such as price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, square footage, year built, view ratings, and sale dates for homes.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- PySpark (Spark SQL module)  
- findspark (to initialize Spark environment)  
- Parquet file format for optimized data storage and querying  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## Project Steps & Features

1. **Initialize SparkSession:** Set up the Spark environment to process large datasets.  
2. **Load CSV Data:** Read `home_sales_revised.csv` from S3 into a Spark DataFrame.  
3. **Create Temporary View:** Generate a Spark SQL temporary table `home_sales` for querying.  
4. **Run SQL Queries:**  
   - Average price per year for four-bedroom homes.  
   - Average price per year built for homes with 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms.  
   - Average price per year built for homes with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 2 floors, and ≥ 2,000 sqft.  
   - Average home price per "view" rating where the average price ≥ $350,000, including query runtime.  
5. **Cache Table:** Cache the `home_sales` temporary table and validate caching.  
6. **Compare Performance:** Measure and compare query runtimes on cached vs. uncached data.  
7. **Partition Data:** Write the DataFrame as parquet files partitioned by `date_built`.  
8. **Parquet Data Querying:** Read parquet files into a new temporary view and rerun queries for runtime comparison.  
9. **Uncache Table:** Uncache the temporary `home_sales` table and verify.  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Home_Sales.git
   cd Home_Sales
